### How the Game Works:
- The computer picks a random number, for example between 1 and 100.

- You (the user) try to guess what it is.

- After each guess, the computer gives you a hint:

- If your guess is too low, it says "Too low!"

- If your guess is too high, it says "Too high!"

- If you guess it correctly, it says "You got it!"

- The game keeps going until you guess the correct number
